## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ankit-1607/Gen-AI-based-Image-Caption-Generator.git
   cd Gen-AI-based-Image-Caption-Generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Run Locally

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 2. Via Google Colab

> *Note: Running the application via colab will give better performance than Streamlit deployed app due to free tier resource allocation difference.*

> **How to run the application using google colab:**

* Change the runtime type to ‚ÄòT4 GPU‚Äô to observe significantly better response time after intital model load.

* ‚ÄòRun All‚Äô cells.

* Scroll to the last cell which uses localtunnel to provide a temporary online url to view the application.

* Copy the IP address of ‚ÄòExternal URL‚Äô.

*  e.g. in the below shown image copy 34.16.168.188

* Click on the ‚Äòyour url‚Äô and go to the page link and paste the copied IP Address as tunnel password and explore the application.

**Google Colab link:** [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v-NeTNbOsabLxek-pihdkxiAI1vRfI18?usp=sharing)

### 3. Deployed Streamlit App

Access the live application deployed on Streamlit sharing:

**Streamlit Deployed Application**:[AI Image Caption Generator](https://gen-ai-image-caption-generator.streamlit.app/)

> *Note: The Streamlit deployment is hosted on a free tier, so performance may be slower compared to running on a GPU-enabled Colab instance.*
